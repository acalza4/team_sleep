Include the detailed code and analysis results of those points only; you should spend more time/code/plots on your main point than the others.\n",

Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",

    "\n",
    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project has obvious potential concerns with ethics or data privacy discuss that here.  Almost every ML project put into production can have ethical implications if you use your imagination. Use your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you can't come up with an obvious ethical concern that should be addressed, you should know that a large number of ML projects that go into producation have unintended consequences and ethical problems once in production. How will your team address these issues?\n",

    "Consider a tool to help you address the potential issues such as https://deon.drivendata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
